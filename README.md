# Empowerize-Job_Seekers_Mobile_App

EMPOWERIZE is a platform that allows job searchers and employers to connect together with the goal of empowering job seekers in Sri Lanka. It will positively affect Sri Lanka's economy by solving the issue of unemployment, a major contributor to the country's economic crisis.

The application enables job seekers looking for work to make their own accounts, keep those accounts up-to-date, check for jobs, and apply for jobs when they meet the requirements. Companies can also make their own accounts and keep up with their business profiles. Something else Besides that, they can offer their job vacancies to job seekers through the app.

We are using Kotlin (Android Studio) and Firebase to develop this mobile application.
